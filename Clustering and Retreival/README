This is a basic model of the nearest neighbor search. The distance between any two fields is calculated by Euclidian and Cosine Distance
methods. For calculating more accurate similarity we use TF-IDF instead of simple bag of words. Graphlab Create library is used for
the distance metrics.


LSH IMPEMENTATION:
Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) provides for a fast, efficient approximate nearest neighbor search. The algorithm scales well with respect
to the number of data points as well as dimensions.
